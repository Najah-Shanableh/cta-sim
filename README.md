Project Overview
================

CTA project for the DSSG program.

<h3> Context </h3>
The CTA is the Chicago Transit Authority. Among other things, they manage the Chicago bus system, which encompasses over 10000 stops.
At every stop, CTA uses door sensors to log all of the passengers that get on and off the bus. Additionally, each bus is equipped with a GPS that allows CTA to collect data on when the bus arrives at each stop (early, late, on-time).
<h3> Problem </h3>
The CTA bus system has problems with bunching (buses piling up because they are late or early) and crowding (too many people on buses).
Currently, the CTA uses historical data to plan their quarterly schedules, with no form of predictive modeling. This means that if the CTA makes a schedule change, they have to wait 3 months to evaluate the effect of that change on such variables as bunching and crowding.
<h3> Solution Prototype </h3>
We are building a predictive model for demand. This model will be used in a simple Java web application that will display a variety of charts, graphs, and figures generated from analysis of the data.
<h3> Impact </h3>
This project will hopefully reduce the issues of bunching and crowding for the bus system, which will in turn make Chicago transit more efficient and enjoyable for the many people who rely on it to get to work.
