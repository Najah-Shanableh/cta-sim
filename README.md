DSSG: CTA-Project
=================

<h1> Introduction </h1>
<h3> Context </h3>
The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has made a concerted effort to decrease the crowding on public transportation that has been a 
cause for concern over the last few years. The CTA has been collecting information such as: the number of people riding a 
specific bus, the times at which more people board buses at a specific stop, and the delay times on different routes, among other
things. This data, after some processing, is used to understand and modify schedules and routes for the following quarter.

<h3> Prototype idea </h3>
While current best practices are data-focused, they are retrospective in nature. We propose to turn scheduling into a more 
prospective exercise through statistical modeling and simulation. This will allow the planning analytics department to be more
proactive and to better understand the impact of certain scheduling decisions on bus crowding before implementation. Given the 
richness of the data available, we believe that even a simple statistical model and simulation approach will provide useful 
insight into bus de-crowding.

Our tool will display historical data with the metrics the CTA uses today and will incorporate new metrics along with simulated
data. The new data will help the CTA have a deeper understanding of the results that arise from schedule changes. This new
understanding will help the CTA in the effort to reduce crowding on buses.

<h3> Impact </h3>
The CTA bus service has more than 950,000 riders on an average weekday. By reducing the crowding on buses, we will hopefully
increase the quality of life of many daily commuters and help the CTA move more people around the city.
